# php-myq-liftmaster
PHP scripts to control basic open/close functions for a MyQ garage door.

### Instructions for Use
After cloning the repo, edit the `sample.config.ini` file to add your username/email and password that you would use to connect to MyQ. Then run the included `door.php` script to verify connectivity. From there, feel free to use the `MyQ.php` class file in whatever project you'd like.

## TO-DO
I just started this recently. At the moment it just fetches door state. Soon it'll have full functionality _for a single door_. I'm sure someone out there has multiple doors they want to control - if I get enough serious interest I'll look into supporting that, but I'm not super rich like all you 2-4 garage door billionaires, so you just might have to wait.
